# Testing Code for "Bluffing and Negotiations in General Game-Playing AI" Research Project

This repository contains the experimental setup used to generate our results. It was written in C# and built using Visual Studio. The program's entry point is `BluffingGGP/Program.cs`.

This repository is based on the experimental setup by Sean Zammit that can be accessed at https://github.com/z5207033/ZT23-Experimental-Setup/tree/main.
